                        <p>We are a team of Victoria high school grads who are showcasing the value of our education. Weâ€™ve experienced first hand the challenges that educators have collecting data and making sense of it. Our technology fills the gap.  Not only do we create the platforms, but we also guide the analysis of the data for the benefit of both school and student.</p>
